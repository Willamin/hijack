 >Smartwatch HTTP requests
  >Server webpage
   >Set a value in [something] (mysql?)
    >in java program, loop and check a webpage
     >do a set of commands based on what value is returned
      >reset the value in [something] (mysql?)

next step:
write the backend; maybe an arbitrary keyvalue pair such that the request is "host.com/request?k=alice&v=true" and the get is "host.com/get?k=alice" which returns "true"
